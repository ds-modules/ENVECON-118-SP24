    "This exercise is to be completed using R. We will establish a simple linear relationship between **housing prices and characteristics of location** in the sample. This is called a hedonic regression, relating price to characteristics. The idea is that if a characteristic is valued in a region, like good schools, demand for housing increases as people move there, and then housing prices increase, all else constant. Vice versa, if people do not value a characteristic, like crime.  \n",

    "When there is a clean-up in former hazardous waste locations, what happens to the prices of houses nearby? This problem set explores individuals’ willingness to pay (WTP) for environmental quality by estimating whether increasing environmental quality impacts housing prices in the area. For this problem set, the change in environmental quality results from the cleanup of hazardous waste sites. Consider Superfund sites, areas designated by the US government as contaminated by hazardous waste that pose a hazard to environmental/human health. The EPA placed certain Superfund sites on the National Priorities List (npl=1), which meant that these sites were legally required to undergo remediation. If individuals value environmental quality, then housing prices should increase after nearby NPL sites are cleaned up. To determine the extent to which individuals value the cleanup, we can compare housing close to a hazardous waste site that was cleaned up to “comparable” homes near a similar waste site that was not cleaned up.
